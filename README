Github Tutorial - work in progress

I have created this tutorial to share my knowledge on github through out my coding journey. 
The tutorial will be updated constantly whenever i will learn new stuff about github and will keep the tutorial simple
so that beginners or anyone want to manage their project can focus on coding rather than management.

So, Happy Coding ;)
